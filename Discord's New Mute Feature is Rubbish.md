Yep, as you can see, Discord brought in their own mute feature, made to mute someone from talking in channels and voice chats. However, that feature is dumb and useless as bots also do that and the mute roles can be modified such as allowing members to chat in a 'mute channel' or make the whole server unviewable.

# Why is it rubbish?
         
* Discord is attempting to kill the mute feature the bots have but most servers have specific time that a person should be muted for (for example, if a moderator wants to mute someone for 30 minutes for spam).
* Possible mute evasion can happen. With most bots, if someone tries to mute evade by leaving and rejoining, the bot remembers that this person was muted and automatically adds the mute role to them. But with Discord's mute punishment, muted members can mute evade.
* The mute times provided by the Discord's mute feature have set times. They won't allow you to set your own time as I see them as "too short". Even some servers would perma-mute members.

# Will developers remove the mute features from their bots?
I don't believe so but if a bot dev decided to remove the mute feature, then I have lost hope in them. Also, I will **NOT** remove the mute feature from Jeanne. Even some devs I know is refusing to revoke their bot's mute feature.

# Conclusion
I belive the new mute feature won't last for a year or better yet, a month. Discord can attempt to kill more bots because of their own features they are bringing but most bots had them before Discord brought them up.
