So you just looked at the title and you gonna ask me why? Here's what happened:

So while I was testing out the commands in the images module (as always) to check
if it will return with lolis or crossing the NSFW borderline, the wallpaper command
returned an NSFW pic. I was bit surprised but then I notice that I was testing them
in an NSFW enabled channel. So I disabled the NSFW in the channel and tried again but
I got the same result. Just to make sure it was not only the server (because the 
server is NSFW based), I tried it in another server but got the same results. 
Wallpaper is returning me NSFW pics. And for one more time trying to see if it 
would happen again, I tried in Koneko's server (The developer of the RiasBot) 
and unfortunately, same result.

Just to be on the safe side, I added '@commands.is_nsfw()' on the wallpaper command
(both prefixed and slash) so if anyone tries to execute this command, it will return
with an NSFW error message if the channel is not NSFW enabled. I do not care if SFW
pics come from the wallpaper command, still, the command gave me 3 NSFW pics.
